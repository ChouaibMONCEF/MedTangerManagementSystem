TANGER MED TECH - Dock management and appointment booking:  When tackling the optimization of your supply chain, each step must be taken into account. The quays of a port are a crucial point in a supply chain. They can represent a real bottleneck and jeopardize the fluidity of flows, ultimately penalizing the quality of service and customer satisfaction. In recent months, the problem of compliance with health measures has been added to guarantee the safety of drivers and teams at the dock. The driver reception must therefore adapt and good management of the docks becomes all the more important.
